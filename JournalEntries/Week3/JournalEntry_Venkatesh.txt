Week 3
I make sure that we as a team follow the XP principle Feed back.
Feedback can be from customer, system(via unit test), and through acceptance tests.

04/18/2016 and 04/19/2016

During this phase we worked together on the integration part of the completed modules. After integration we tested the combined functionality of the codules to 
get the feed back from the system. In addition to it we also showed demo of the functionality to other team mates to get their feed back.

04/20/2016 and 04/21/2016
During this phase we worked on the implementation of the state pattern to determine the state of the game. Ideas were thrown in the middle
by each person and others gave feedback on the implementation. Finally we decided it would be best if we implement states such as players turn, bot turn and 
card distribution state. We also decided on the unit test that would be needed for the state pattern which is necessary to get the feed back from the system.

04/22/2016
This day invloved with more integration of the command pattern with the state pattern which resulted in change of state on button click. After integration we did test 
to get feed back from the system to ensure the required functionality is achieved. Also induvidual team members shared their feed back after integration on things like
the appearance on the UI, customization issues etc which were noted down.
