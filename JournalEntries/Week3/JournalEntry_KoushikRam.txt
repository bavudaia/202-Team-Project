Week 3
My main aim is to facilitate proper communication in the team. I made sure that everyone communicates with every other person and there is no gap in communication.

04/18/2016 and 04/19/2016
We mainly concentrated on Integration of the Design patterns for the first two days.
The main issue that we faced was during integration. We found out that some of the functions were redunandat. We decided to remove the redunancy in 
the code by removing them.

We also decided to implement State pattern, which will cover the major functional area of the game. 
We also decided to simplify everything. We were increasing the complexity unknowingly abd we decided not to do that in future.
 This was needed in order to move forward with the rest of implementation.
 
04/20/2016 and 04/21/2016
We divided the entire game into various states and transition between various states was the key module that we worked on.
 We identified three key states and started workeing on it. Myself and Bala did pair programming and implemented State pattern.
I along with Bala, dud pait programming and helped each other. We both implemented two states and handed over the other state to Venkat and Siva.
We also ensured that everone was in the same page and we would complete the project before project due date.
