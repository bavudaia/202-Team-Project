In this project I make sure we follow xp value "Feedback". Feed back can be from customers or from the system ( via unit and acceptance tests)

We planned to integrate the individual modules that every one did. The feed back from the system was not good as the test failed while integrating.
Team members analysed the code and gave feedback on what the things could be done inorder to solve various issue. We also checked with the initial timeline we 
came up for the project and found out that we were lagging. So decided to hasten things up and keep it simple.

Integrating the modules continued. Some of the logic failed after integration as they were too complex and didn't couple together properly. 
We as a team analysed and gave feedback to reduce the complexity of the modules so that atleast the base functinality is achieved for the black jack game.

Initial integration of the modules were completed to certain extent. After that each member went through the integrated module and gave feed back on what should 
be added or improved for the next iteration. Based on the collective feedback we decided to keep things simple and get the work done in time.
