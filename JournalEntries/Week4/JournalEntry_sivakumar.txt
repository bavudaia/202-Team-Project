This is the integration stage. we have completed many of our individual modules. So we had to respect the work done by individuals and more than that the important part here is to respect the quality and benchmarks that is required for the project. We came together and planned our next course of action and steps to complete the project successfully.

Integrating the modules continued. Some of the logic failed after integration as they were too complex and didn't couple together properly. 
At this juncture my aim was to communicate the team to complete the bare minimum for the successful working of the black jack game. I aced this task with utmost respect and hence the core value was very important here.

After the previous work we had some positives and team became excited after seeing the initial success. I felt that this was very important for us to keep up with the same momentum so that we could get the best out of each other and thus earning the respect of our fellow comrades in the class.
