Week 4
My role in this team is to follow the XP value of Eliminate Waste and instill the same value in the team.
24 to 26 April 2016,
Considering this was the final week, we had to speed up our work. We still had plenty of functionalities left to implement. So our emphasis was on integration of the code and finishing implementation of core business logic. Thus following the XP Value Eliminating Waste became the most important value for the team to follow if the project needs to be completed on time. I emphasized on the need to remove certain aspects of the functionalities which unnecessarily complicated the flow of the project, this was done mainly with the aim of reducing the time for the integration of modules. Since lesser the complexity, lesser the time to integrate the module. For instance, the scoring module which implements the strategy pattern refreshes the same score twice due to a faulty algorithm. I modified this flow and made it refresh only once thus eliminating waste.

We implemented final changes to the business logic to keep the application up and running. Once , again I made sure only the mandatory requirements were being fixed thanks to the time constraints. A communicated with my team members to remove lots of overtly complicated non-critical functionalities.
28 and 29 April 2016,
We believe the work is almost done with the integration of modules close to completion. I believe that by sticking to our core XP values , our team was able to complete the work on time. There are still some minor bugs left to fix, but those wouldn’t take too much time since, our project is highly modularized and making changes to one module wouldn’t affect the other. I asked my teammates to only work on modules those we felt would surely be utilized in the future which eliminated a lot of waste and contributed directly in the completion of the project.
