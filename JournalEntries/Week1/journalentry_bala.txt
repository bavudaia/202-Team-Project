I have chosen to add the value of Courage to the project team
Courage:
04/04/2016 : Project Title decision phase:
Each person in the team was assigned one activity in the first meeting
In the meeting, I encouraged the team to do research in a 
rigorous manner to get a fine project title.

04/05/2016 and 04/06/2016 :
First day we met with 4 members with project titles. All titles were
good and each member were not articulating their titles well. I encouraged the team
to make changes with their project titles. As I have a good experience 
in OOP I analyzed each and every one idea and gave suggestions to 
improve on each idea , so that in the next meeting we can have 
good contenders.This widened their though processes, helping them
to come up with a good idea next meeting. In the next meeting 
the project title black jack proposed by Koushik was selected. 

04/07/2016 and 04/08/2016 : 

In these meeting we had to identify Object oriented patterns, Use cases
and assign design patterns to each of them. I have asked every one 
to not get stuck in a problem and be persistent. If one solution 
does not seem good they have to get rid of it and think freshly.

Hence I believe I have instilled some courage in the team.
