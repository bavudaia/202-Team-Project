Communication-
4/4/2016- 
We first gathered as a team and we decided to meet face to face at
least three times a week. We decided to work together on everything from requirements 
to code. We decided to create the best solution to the problem that we have. 

4/5/2016 to 4/7/2016-We were discussing the various aspects of the projects and the 
possible things that can be done. We mainly concentrated on developing a card game. 
We analyzed various card games such as Poker, Black Jack, Hearts, Uno etc. 
We mainly analyzed the pros and cons in implementing each of the games and also 
considered the ease of implementation. Apart from that, we also considered the 
design patterns that could be implemented.

4/8/2016-We finally decided to go with Black Jack. 
We also decided the Design pattern for each of the team member. 
Everyone was assigned with at least one design pattern, which they have to concentrate. 
We also decided to work as a team and not to just complete the design pattern, 
but also collaborate and help each other.
