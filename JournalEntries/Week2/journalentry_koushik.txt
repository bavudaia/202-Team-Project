Week 2

My role is to maintain good Communication in the team, which is also the core XP value that I took.

We decided to start the coding for design patterns. We assigned each team member with a design pattern during the previous week and our goal 
for this week
was to kick start the coding. I made sure that there was proper communication between all the team members, so that we all were in the same page.

We started coding as a team and we decided to go with Pair programming as the team size is 6 and we didn't want all 6 to work on a 
different piece of code. This greatly
enhanced the team spirit and we divided ourselves in to a team of 2. 2*3=6.

We mainly concentrated on quality of code. We also decided to review the code among sub-groups in order to improve the coding standards and also 
decrease potentail problems
due to miscommunication.

We decided to follow the same strategy in the upcoming weeks as well.
