Design Pattern: Chain of responsibility
XP Core Value : Courage


The core XP value I have chosen to instill for the BlackJack Single player game project is Courage.
04/18 , 04/19
We worked hard on coding and testing the same. I encouraged every team member to concentrate on their modules and not get intimidated by integration tasks initially. Everybody were on schedule, but the main task was there were more requirements getting added up for which we needed to code. In this juncture, I suggested to worry less about this and made everyone work on their current task.

04/20
I suggested the idea of pair programming, which worked very well as all of knew the requirements to code and constant input was given to improve functionality. Certain parts of code needed to be removed. Many team members were reluctant to remove code. This looked like a potential barrier to me. I encouraged every member to remove code and rework.

04/21,04/22,04/23
We are currently working on all new patterns discovered, reworking code to implement them. In this phase work gets tedious, so we are putting in hours. We are together , in all aspects which gives us more courage that this project will be a success.

XP Core Value : Communication

Journal Entry :
Week 3
My main aim is to facilitate proper communication in the team. I made sure that everyone communicates with every other person and there is no gap in communication.

04/18/2016 and 04/19/2016
We mainly concentrated on Integration of the Design patterns for the first two days.
The main issue that we faced was during integration. We found out that some of the functions were redunandat. We decided to remove the redunancy in 
the code by removing them.

We also decided to implement State pattern, which will cover the major functional area of the game. 
We also decided to simplify everything. We were increasing the complexity unknowingly abd we decided not to do that in future.
 This was needed in order to move forward with the rest of implementation.
 
04/20/2016 and 04/21/2016
We divided the entire game into various states and transition between various states was the key module that we worked on.
 We identified three key states and started workeing on it. Myself and Bala did pair programming and implemented State pattern.
I along with Bala, dud pait programming and helped each other. We both implemented two states and handed over the other state to Venkat and Siva.
We also ensured that everone was in the same page and we would complete the project before project due date.

04/22/2016
We integrated the command pattern with the state pattern, 
Herre we merged every functionality with theie coressponding buttons.Week 3
My role in this team is to follow the XP value of Eliminate Waste and instill the same value in the team.

XP Core Value – Eliminate Waste

Journal Entry:
04/18/2016 and 04/19/2016
We worked on our individual implementations of design patterns and their integration for the first two days. During the integration we faced many issues including redundancy of functionalities. For instance, both mine and Bala’s module had implemented similar functionality for change of states between the players, bots and dealers. So after integration, it brought unnecessary complexity in the system and there was a need to eliminate some of the redundant modules in the function and also simplify them. This was needed in order to move forward with the rest of implementation.
04/20/2016 and 04/21/2016
We worked together as a team on state pattern, wherein we categorized the entire game into three states, namely – players turn, bots turn and card distribution. There were lots of outlandish ideas for state categorization before we arrived on the aforementioned three states. I played a part in simplification of the states since implementation of too many states would lead to unnecessarily complex flow of objects, which would both hinder the performance of the game as well as would prevent us from completing our project before project due date.
04/22/2016
We integrated the command pattern with the state pattern, wherein we merged the functionality of state retrieval from the world class with the individual button clicks.

XP Core Value – Simplicity

Journal Entry:

04-18-2016 and 04-19-2016

The initial 2 days the team split responsibilities and we were involved in intensive coding. I made sure everyone is commenting their code at regular basis to make sure it was easily understandable. At the end of the second day we tried to get feedback from one another on each otherâ€™s code. We also tried to integrate the code and failed at the end of it. But since we followed the simple rule of commenting , the team was easily able to detect anomalies and fix the integration. If the team wouldnâ€™t have commented their code, it would have been really difficult to integrate everyoneâ€™s part of code. This policy of simplicity helped us in quick recovery.

04-20-2016 , 04-21-2016, 04-22-2016

The next three days we were involved in implementing the core logic and also worked together implementing the state design pattern. We started by writing down the pseudo code and the basic requirements first. Then we implemented the first iteration of the code, removed all the unnecessary stuff from our code and repeated the same process. By this we were able to enforce the XP value simplicity which helped us keeping all of our steps in implementing state pattern simple and easy to mitigate failures.
Week 3
My role in this team is to follow the XP value of Respect and instil the same value in the team.

XP Core Value – Respect

Journal Entry:
04/18/2016 and 04/19/2016
During this period of time we were working separately on individual modules to implement corresponding design patterns. We respected each other’s’ time and effort. We streamlined the project work with proper follow up meetings to ensure proper communication for inter dependent modules. People were on time and respected each other. 
04/20/2016 and 04/21/2016
We worked on state patterns together. Every one of us pitched in with interesting ideas. In order to keep them motivated and involved in the discussion. I carefully noted down each ideas from the team members and found redundancies in them. We removed them to reduce the complexity in implementation.  
04/22/2016
We integrated the command pattern with the state pattern, wherein we merged the functionality of state retrieval from the world class with the individual button clicks.

XP core value : Feedback
Week 3
I make sure that we as a team follow the XP principle Feed back.
Feedback can be from customer, system(via unit test), and through acceptance tests.

04/18/2016 and 04/19/2016

During this phase we worked together on the integration part of the completed modules. After integration we tested the combined functionality of the codules to 
get the feed back from the system. In addition to it we also showed demo of the functionality to other team mates to get their feed back.

04/20/2016 and 04/21/2016
During this phase we worked on the implementation of the state pattern to determine the state of the game. Ideas were thrown in the middle
by each person and others gave feedback on the implementation. Finally we decided it would be best if we implement states such as players turn, bot turn and 
card distribution state. We also decided on the unit test that would be needed for the state pattern which is necessary to get the feed back from the system.

04/22/2016
This day invloved with more integration of the command pattern with the state pattern which resulted in change of state on button click. After integration we did test 
to get feed back from the system to ensure the required functionality is achieved. Also induvidual team members shared their feed back after integration on things like
the appearance on the UI, customization issues etc which were noted down.
